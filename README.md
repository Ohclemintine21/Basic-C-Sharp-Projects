C# Projects

 Small C# and .NET Framework projects I've made.
 
 Projects:
 
 - Car Insurance
 
 https://github.com/Ohclemintine21/Basic-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/master/CarInsurance
 
  This is a MVC web application as a recreation/mimic of a car insurance website. It takes the user's
 input on policy information and calcuates a quote based on business logic. There is alos an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that 
 have been issued.
 
 - Student login 
 
 MVC web application that takes the student user's input for login information and adds a new student to the Database.
 
 
 -Code First App
 
 https://github.com/Ohclemintine21/HTML-and-CSS-Projects/tree/master/portfolio
 
 This was C-Sharp project where I worked on understanding how Controllers and Models are written and with Asp.Net MVC Framework
