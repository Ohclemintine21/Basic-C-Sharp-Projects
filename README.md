 Car Insurance
 
 This is a MVC web application as a recreation/mimic of a car insurance website. It takes the user's
 input on policy information and calcuates a quote based on business logic. There is alos an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that 
 have been issued.
 
 
 Student Login
 
 MVC web application that takes the student user's input for login information and adds a new student to the Database.
